> **Note:** This project is in an early stage of development. Even the core functionality, such as automating data collection and prediction, is not yet fully implemented. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

# **Project Goals**

The **primary goal** of this project is to evaluate the applicability of predictive models, such as **ARIMA** or **XGBoost**, on cryptocurrency time series data. The project emphasizes automating the collection and analysis of diverse combinations of data with the following structure:

- **Cryptocurrency Name**
- **Prediction Model**
- **Model Parameters**
- **Time Interval**

Currently, the project is a **Python + PostgreSQL pipeline** designed to automate data collection and prediction for cryptocurrency forecasting.

**NOW IN DEVELOPMENT**

## **Extended Future Goals**

This project also aspires to achieve **broader objectives**, which would benefit from more contributors:

1. **Discover an Algorithm for Predicting Cryptocurrency Trends** *(ha-haa!)*

2. **Develop a Comprehensive "Custom Crypto Forecasting" Service**:
   - Allowing users to build **personalized forecasts** based on the above data structure.
   - Essential steps include:
     - **API Integration**
     - **Frontend Development**
     - **Cloud Migration**
